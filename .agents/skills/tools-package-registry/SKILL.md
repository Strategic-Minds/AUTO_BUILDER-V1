# Tools Package Registry

## Purpose
Maintain the MCP and tool registry with allowed actions, dry-run rules, approvals, rollback, secrets policy, receipts, and fallback tool routing.

## Operating contract
- Start with PHASE, STEP, TODO when this skill is active.
- Keep work branch-safe, sandboxed, draft-only, or dry_run unless operator approval is explicit.
- Read source truth before planning implementation.
- Emit receipts for decisions, validations, approvals, blockers, and rollbacks.
- Stop for production deploys, secrets, payments, live publishing, customer messages, destructive database actions, DNS, account provisioning, or spend.

## Required inputs
- request_id
- operator_intent
- source_truth_links_or_paths
- agent_scope
- tool_scope
- Drive_scope
- Supabase_scope
- approval_state

## Required outputs
- decision_summary
- verified_facts
- inferred_items
- blocked_items
- receipt_requirements
- rollback_requirements
- next_actions

## Validation checklist
- Confirm source truth exists or mark missing.
- Confirm required tables, folders, templates, or routes are named explicitly.
- Confirm no live mutation is requested without approval.
- Confirm every action maps to a receipt.
- Confirm rollback or fallback exists.
